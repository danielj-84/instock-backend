## About The Project 
* **The Challenge:** This was an Agile project leveraging JIRA and mimicking a sprint. Our educators gave us a list of required features/functionality and a figma mockup.
* **The Approach:** 
  * We divided the requirements into tickets and estimated their effort in dev/hours.
  * We planned the sprint and assigned tickets among the team.
  * Each team member was the team lead for a day and had to review/approve the PRs from the other team members.
  * Every morning we had a stand-up to discuss progress and any blockers in our tickets.
* **The Application:** 
  *  A fully fledged  warehouse and inventory tracking full-stack web-app
  *  Mobile-first design and fully responsive to other screen sizes

## Lessons Learned
* Descriptive and meaningful commit and/or comment messages are essential to the success of a team and of utmost importance in a collaborative development environment.
* When in charge of reviewing PRs, it’s important to set clear expectations for yourself and your teammates about getting your own tasks as well as the PRs done. There’s no need to rush and/or abandon your own workflow to jump to a PR as long as everyone is kept in the loop and everything is completed in a reasonable time frame.
